# üç∞ HookedJS

A Scalable Full-Stack in a box: web+native+backend, built with react, graphql, and passport.

## Status

Feature Incomplete: Each microservice is working but they are not yet working together. Current development effort is focused on Eusy, our open-source React framework that will be used as the foundation of HookedJS's React microservice.

## Install

As of now, HookedJS requires MacOS in order to build IOS apps.

1. [Install homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
2. [Install nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script)
3. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
1. Install Xcode from the App Store and open it to accept the user agreement.
2. Follow [the official React Native instructions](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) to configure your machine for IOS and Android using the "React Native CLI Quickstart" tab, NOT the "Expo CLI Quickstart" tab.

Then, 

```
brew install gnu-sed
brew install postgres
brew install node
brew install watchman
brew tap AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk
brew cask install adoptopenjdk8
nvm install 10
nvm use 10
npm i -g typescript yarn
yarn bootstrap
```

## Development

A local development env can be launched by (1) starting Docker and (2) running 

```
yarn start:dev
```

### Developing Native Apps

`yarn start:dev` does not start IOS or Android emulators. To start those, go to services/react and read that README.md

## Environmental Variables

This framework uses env variables and .env files to control app settings, 
like ports and database connections. Basically, put your developer settings
inside of .env, and the app will use those settings by default if
they are not set in the shell already. In other words, you can easily 
override the .env settings simply by setting the variable in the 
shell before calling `yarn bootstrap` or `yarn env:sync`
